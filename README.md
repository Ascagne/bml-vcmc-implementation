### Implementation of VCMC for bayesian probit regression, by Matthieu Plotton and Julien Chapuy

We implemented a simple version of VCMC on the Bayesian probit regression case in the context of our Bayesian Machine Learning course given by RÃ©mi Bardenet for the Master 2 Data Science in Lille.

The reader only need to open the main notebook `main.ipynb` to execute this implementation that will automatically import required companion files.

## Installation

Install the package in development mode

```bash
cd bml-vcmc-implementation
conda develop .
```
